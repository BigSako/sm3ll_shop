# django-crest-example
This is an example for a simple Django App with EVE Online Single Sign-On (SSO) and authenticated CREST access.

It depends on [python-social-auth](http://psa.matiasaguirre.net/) to integrate EVE SSO with Django's builtin user authentication system and uses [pycrest](https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&t=398676) to interact with the CREST API.

A live demo is available at http://django-crest-example.dubiose-briefkastenfirma.de/
